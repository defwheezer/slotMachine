# slotMachine
python code for a probabilistic slot machine using Pygame and Numpy

Runs using Python v2.7, Pygame v1.9

Reels are rendered as sprites and "spun", the final image displayed is chosen based on a pre-defined probability distribution. 
The probability distribution can be tweaked manually using a spreadsheet program to get the desired odds.

A "bribe" is also included to entice the user to stay in the game.

The Pygame iteration of this slot machine program was designed for a Halloween theme.
